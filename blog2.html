        <p class="container container-center SIZE">  The article explains a few less common git commands, which are extremely useful. 
            There are many rare git commands, in this article, we will see 5 of them, and we will keep exploring more such git commands in upcoming articles.<br><br>
            Let’s explore them <br><br>

            <h2 id="GIT-CHERRY-PICK" class="container container-center"> 1. GIT CHERRY-PICK </h2><br> <br> 
            <div class="container container-center SIZE">The purpose of ‘cherry-pick’ command is to choose a commit from one branch and apply it to another branch.<BR>

                Consider we have 2 branches, ‘main’ and ‘demo’. We are at the ‘main’ branch, we have some commits in the ‘main’ branch which we need to push to the ‘demo’ branch. Cherry-picking is a three-step process.<BR>
                <br>
                Step1: Move to ‘demo’ branch, branch where we need to apply the change
            </div>
        </p>
    </article>

   

     <br> 

    <div class=" container container-MIDDLE CODE SIZE"> $ git checkout 'demo'</div> <br>
    <div class="SIZE container-center">Step2: cherry-pick the commit id from the 'main' branch. </div><br>
    <div class=" container container-MIDDLE CODE "> $ git cherry-pick 15cd2879d506bdc02</div> <br><br> 
    <div class="SIZE container-center">Step3: Push . </div><br>
    <div class=" container container-MIDDLE CODE "> $ git push</div> <br><br>
    <div class="SIZE container-center">Our cherry-picked commit is now in the ‘demo’ branch. </div><br>



    <h2 id="GIT-RESET" Class="container container-center"> 2. GIT RESET </h2><br> <br> <BR>
    <div class="container container-center SIZE">
        Sometimes we think a bunch of changes are ready for committing – but directly after making the commit, we notice that we were too quick.<BR><BR>

Changes could be missing, we could have hit the wrong branch, or a multitude of other problems could have happened. <BR><BR>

The only thing that's certain: we'd like to undo this last commit and get our changes back into our Working Copy!<BR><BR>

We can use the git reset command with a special set of options:<BR><BR> 
  
    </h3> <br>

    <div class=" container container-MIDDLE CODE "> $ git reset --mixed HEAD~1 </div> <br><br> 
    <div class="container container-center ">
        The "--mixed" option makes sure that the changes contained in the commits being reset are NOT discarded. Instead, they are preserved as local changes in the Working Copy.<BR><BR>

        Using the "HEAD~1" notation is a great shortcut to specify "the commit before the latest one" – which is exactly what we want in order to undo the very last commit.<BR><BR>

    <h2 id="GIT-DIFF" Class="container container-center"> 3. GIT DIFF </h2><br> 
    <div class="container container-center ">
        After making some changes to a file in a feature branch, you might want to compare it to how it looks on another branch. <br>
        for eg:<br>
        you are currently on the "feature/login" branch and want to understand how the file "myFile.txt" here is different from its version on the "develop" branch.<br><br>
        The git diff command can do this if you provide the following parameters:
    </div><br> 
    
    
    <div class=" container container-MIDDLE CODE "> $ git diff develop -- myFile.txt</div> <br>
    <div class="container container-center ">
        You'll then see a nice, clear diff that shows how exactly your file differs from its version on the other branch.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class=" container container-MIDDLE CODE "> $ git branch -a </div> <br> 
    <div class="container container-center ">
        View all branches and see which branch you’re currently working on:
    </div> <br> 
   


    <h3 id="GIT-SWITCH" class="container container-center"> 4. GIT SWITCH</h3><br> <br> 
            <div class="container container-center ">The git checkout command has a multitude of different jobs and meanings.<BR>
                 That's why, pretty recently, the Git community decided to publish a new command:
                 git switch. As the name implies, it was made specifically for the task of switching branches:<BR>
            </div><br> 
          <br> 
            <div class=" container container-MIDDLE CODE "> $ git switch develop </div> <br> 
        
            <div class="container container-center ">
                As you can see, its usage is very straightforward and similar to "git checkout". 
                But the huge advantage over the "checkout" command is that "switch" does NOT have a million other meanings and capabilities.


            </div><br> 
            <div class="container container-center ">
                In some scenarios, it might be necessary for you to switch back and forth between two branches repeatedly. 
                Instead of always writing out the branch names in full, you can simply use the following shortcut:


            </div><br> 

            <div class=" container container-MIDDLE CODE "> $ git switch - </div> <br> <br> 
            <div class="container container-center ">
                Using the dash character as its only parameter, the "git switch" command will check out the previously active branch. 
                As said, this can come in very handy if you have to go back and forth between two branches a bunch of times.

            </div><br> 



            <h2 id="GIT-RESTORE" class="container container-center"> 5. GIT RESTORE</h2><br> <br> 
            <div class="container container-center ">Until recently, you had to use some form of git checkout or git reset when you wanted to undo local changes. <BR><BR>

                But with the git restore command, we now have a command that was made exactly for this purpose. This sets it apart from "checkout" and "reset", because those commands have plenty of other use cases.<BR><BR>
                
                Here's a quick overview of the most important things you can do with "git restore":<BR><BR>
            </div><br> 
            
           <br> 
            <div class=" container container-MIDDLE CODE "> # Unstaging a file, but leaving its actual changes untouched
                $ git restore --staged myFile.txt <BR>
                
                # Discarding your local changes in a certain file
                $ git restore myFile.txt <BR>
                
                # Undoing all of the local changes in the working copy (be careful)<BR>
                $ git restore . </div> <br> 
        
            <div class="container container-center ">
                The git restore command offers another very helpful option named "--source". With this option's help, you can easily restore any previous version of a specific file:



            </div><br> 
            <div class=" container container-MIDDLE CODE ">$ git restore --source 6bcf266b index.html</div> <br> 
            <div class="container container-center ">
                If you need some help finding the right revision, you can use a desktop Git client like Tower: with a feature like its "File History", 
                you can easily inspect only the changes that happened in a certain file – and then select a revision to restore.

            </div><br> 
            <div class="container container-center ">
                Although Git is so well-known these days, much of its power is still unknown to the public. 
                It's true that you can "survive" with just a handful commands like commit, push, and pull. But this is like driving a Ferrari in first gear only! <BR><BR>

If you're willing to dive a bit deeper, you will discover some of the more powerful features of Git.
 And these have the potential to not only make you more productive, but also – ultimately – a better developer!<BR>
